       "'daniel greenfield shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is new york writer focusing on radical islam in the final stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton ha gone to war with the fbi the word unprecedented ha been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but it s still unprecedented for the nominee of major political party to go war with the fbi but that s exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patient just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital bed would assume that fbi director james comey is hillary s opponent in this election the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillary s people have circulated letter attacking comey there are currently more medium hit piece lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldn t be too surprising if the clinton or their ally were to start running attack ad against the fbi the fbi s leadership is being warned that the entire left wing establishment will form lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbi s credibility is being attacked by the medium and the democrat to preemptively head off the result of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton the covert struggle between fbi agent and obama s doj people ha gone explosively public the new york time ha compared comey to j edgar hoover it bizarre headline james comey role recall hoover s fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that it s spouting nonsense the boston globe ha published column calling for comey s resignation not to be outdone time ha an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all woman james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he wa still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republican and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy wa stretch countless medium story charge comey with violating procedure do you know what s procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server senator harry reid ha sent comey letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is nice idea that ha a much relevance in the age of obama a the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with medium hack glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracy against hillary ever if james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of strange way to do it not too long ago democrat were breathing sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton pas in prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation wa he on the payroll of house republican and the kgb back then and playing it coy or wa it sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking look at anthony weiner s computer either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or he s just awkwardly trying to navigate political mess that ha trapped him between doj leadership whose political future are tied to hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agent just want to be allowed to do their job the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associate decided to go to war with respected federal agency most american like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys 60 unfavorable rating and it s an interesting question hillary s old strategy wa to lie and deny that the fbi even had criminal investigation underway instead her associate insisted that it wa security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach ha given way to savage assault on the fbi pretending that nothing wa wrong wa bad strategy but it wa better one that picking fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associate try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb there are two possible explanation hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she belief that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory firework display could lead her to declare war on the fbi for irritating her during the final mile of her campaign but the other explanation is that her people panicked going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of smart and focused presidential campaign it s an act of desperation when presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi that s not hubris it s fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton wa confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is paranoid wreck within short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country ha been replaced by desperate and flailing operation that ha focused all it energy on fighting the fbi there s only one reason for such bizarre behavior the clinton campaign ha decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of email pose threat to it survival and so it s gone all in on fighting the fbi it s an unprecedented step born of fear it s hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tell u whole lot clinton loyalist rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time a well a they knew the debate question now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid you can smell the fear the fbi ha wiretap from the investigation of the clinton foundation it s finding new email all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeister of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all that s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isn t how you react to smoke it s how you respond to fire the misguided assault on the fbi tell u that hillary clinton and her ally are afraid of revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup wa preemptive cover up the clinton campaign ha panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup wa meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed the clinton have weathered countless scandal over the year whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assault and abuse of power that have followed them around throughout the year this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegation that have already come out and they don t want fbi investigator anywhere near it the campaign against comey is pure intimidation it s also warning any senior fbi people who value their career are being warned to stay away the democrat are closing rank around their nominee against the fbi it s an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand hillary clinton ha awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandal in just this election cycle but she s never shown fear or desperation before now that ha changed whatever she is afraid of it lie buried in her email with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else ha'"
